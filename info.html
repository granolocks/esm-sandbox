        Erika Senft Miller is a conceptual performance artist actively exploring and embracing the power of movement through rigorous academic research, a careful pattern of creative productivity, and in-depth multimedia integration and documentation of her work. Including five languages, seventeen relocations, and twenty years teaching at universities and community centers, Miller’s life has been as dynamic and site-specific as her creative output. The boundary between her art and the rest of her life is something she has never considered to be a necessary distinction, always furthering the nuances of her creative process regardless of set and setting. In her words, “To work is to play; to play is to work.” Whether through her early ventures into advertising; training with Fe Reichelt; touring with the Panoptikum Movement Theater Company; or personally examining new movement forms like parkour, bouldering, or surfing; she continues to absorb her environment and connect place, experience, and culture.
