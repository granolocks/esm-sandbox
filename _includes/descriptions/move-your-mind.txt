\f0\fs24 \cf0 Created in collaboration with Anna Senft Miller (Erika\'92s daughter), Move Your Mind began as an exploration of the ways in which people interact, learn, and create in the physical space around them. The project is focused on sharing new possibilities for designing and engaging with one\'92s environment that may enhance the mind-body connection and improve energy, focus, creativity, and productivity for people of all ages. \

The project was piloted at the King Street Youth Center in Burlington, Vermont with a tutoring program that pairs young children with community members to work one-on-one toward academic goals. The Miller\'92s shared their research and worked with the tutors to design environmental stimuli for the kids to engage with while learning. The result featured a variety of enhancements including whiteboards on which to draw their multiplication tables, soccer balls to dribble while reciting their weekly vocabulary, and yoga balls to balance on while reading. Following the success of the tutoring program, the Miller\'92s partnered with Generator makerspace and Eugene Korsunskiy, professor of Design Thinking at UVM, to develop a program for the high school group at King Street. Over several weeks, they worked to design and build their own furniture geared toward facilitating more engaged and energized studying.}
